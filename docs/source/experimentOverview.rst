Experiment Overview
###################

The Experiment Overview tab lets you provide basic metadata for your LTE.

Mandatory fields
================

You should complete the following fields:

Experiment Name
    This is the name by which the LTE is commonly known.

Start Year 
    The year the experiment started.

End Year
    If the experiment has ended, the year it ended.

Ongoing
    If the experiment is still running, check this box.

Objective
    Use this text box to describe the primary scientific objectives of the LTE.

Data Access Statement
    The Data Access Statement provides information about how data from your LTE can be accessed. Select a statement from the drop down list. You can provide further details using the *Data Access Notes* text box.

Data Licence
    This indicates the data license under which you normally provide data. If you do not have an agreed license for datasets, select the 'don't know' option.

Data Policy
    A data policy provides glten.org users with information about the conditions for accessing your LTE datasets. If you do not have a data policy select the 'No' option. If your data policy is online you should provide the web address in the 'Data Policy URL' text box.

Optional fields
===============

These fields are not compulsory, but completing them will provide people with more information about your LTE.

Local Identifier
    This is an identifier commonly used to identify the experiment.

Establishment period end year
    An LTE can often take a few years to fully establish. This may be because the experiment design is not finalised or residual effects from previous land-use are still apparent. Data from this period may not therefore be useful for analysis.

Sample archive
    Check this box to indicate samples, for example, crops, fertilizers or soil are routinely collected and kept.

Samples available
    Check this box to indicate samples can be made available for research.
