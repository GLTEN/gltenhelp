Experiment Overview
###################

The Experiment Overview tab lets you provide basic metadata for your LTE.

Mandatory fields
================

As a minimum you should complete the following:

Experiment Name
    This is the name by which the LTE is commonly known.

Start Year 
    The year the experiment started.

End Year
    If the experiment has ended, the year it ended.

Ongoing
    If the experiment is still running, check this box

Objective
    Use this text box to describe the primary scientific objectives of the LTE

Data Access Statement
    The Data Access Statement tells other glten.org users about the availability of data from the LTE. Select a statement from the list of provided options. You can provide further details using the *Data Access Notes* text box

Data Licence
    This indicates to the glten.org user the licence under which you normally provide data. If you do not have an agreed lice for datasets, select the 'don't know' option.

Data Policy
    A data policy provides glten.org users with information about the conditions for accessing your LTE datasets. If you do not have a data policy select the 'No' option. If your data policy is online you should provide the web address in the 'Data Policy URL' text box.

Optional fields
===============

Answering these fields will give glten.org users more information about your LTE.

Local Identifier
    This is an identifier commonly used to identify the experiment.

Establishment period end year
    A Long-term experiment can often take a few years to fully establish. This may be because the experiment design is not finalised or residual effects from previous land-use are still apparent. Data from this period may not therefore be useful for analysis.

Sample archive
    Check this box to indicate samples, for example, produce, vegetation or soil are routinely collected and kept.

Samples available
    Check this box to indicate samples can be made available for research.
