Introduction to the GLTEN metadata editor
=========================================

The GLTEN Metadata Editor is the part of the GLTEN Portal designed to collect information, or metadata, about 
long-term agricultural experiments.

--------------
Getting access
--------------

To submit LTE Metadata you need to be a GLTEN member and have a glten.org account.
If you have an LTE that you would like to add, contact the GLTEN Coordinator at
glten@rothamsted.ac.uk.

-------------------
The Metadata Editor
-------------------
The editor is organized into five main tabs:

1. Experiment overview
2. People/Organizations
3. Site
4. Design
5. Related publications

You must complete the mandatory fields for each tab before submitting your LTE Metadata to review.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How long does it take to create a metadata entry?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Long-term experiments can be complex. Before you start entering LTE Metadata you might want to spend some time considering 
what information you want to provide. Having this information at hand will make
completing your LTE Metadata easier and quicker. 

If you have the information at hand, it should take 1 to 2 hours to create a minimal metadata
entry by completing all *mandatory fields*.

A lot more detailed information can be provided using the *optional fields* and it is up to you
how much time you spend providing this information, but the more you provide, the
more informative will be your LTE Metadata. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About Mandatory Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mandatory fields must be answered. Providing data for these fields will provide other GLTEN
users with enough information to have a basic understanding your LTE.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About Recommended Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You do not need to provide information for recommended fields, but doing so will give other
GLTEN users a better understanding of your LTE.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
About Controlled Vocabulary Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the metadata editor fields use controlled vocabularies to recommend terms.
Using a controlled vocabulary term improves the interoperability of your metadata
as it means metadata is described using defined standard terms. 
Some controlled vocabulary fields will allow you to find terms using synonyms, for example, 
In the *crops* field, typing *alfalfa* or *lucerne* will both prompt for *Medicago sativa*. In 
this case *Medicago sativa* is the preferred name. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Can I save an incomplete metadata entry?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, you can save your metadata and finish editing it at another time. You cannot submit the 
metadata for publication until all mandatory fields have been completed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Validation Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Validation Errors are shown to help identify any mistakes in the LTE metadata, for example an end year is earlier than 
the start year. Validation errors will also highlight missing mandatory fields.

If your LTE Metadata record has validation errors you can save it and continue editing later, but you 
cannot submit it for review. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Submitting your metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have finished editing your metadata you can use the *Publish* tab to 
request review and publication of your LTE Metadata. The GLTEN coordinator will review your
LTE Metadata and publish it. If the GLTEN coordinator finds a mistake they will contact you
to correct it.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updating published metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have published your metadata you can update it at any time, but you must follow
the submission process as described above.
