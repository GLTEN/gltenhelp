The site tab is used to capture metadata about your LTE's location and environment.

*************
Site Location
*************

Mandatory fields
================

Site Name
    This is the name by which your experiment site is commonly known. This can be the same as the experiment name.

Site Latitude and Site Longitude
    The site latitude and longitude provide a point location for your LTE site and are required for adding your LTE
    to the GLTEN.org experiments map. 
    
    The site latitude and longitude must be provided in decimal degrees, not degrees, minutes and seconds. If you do 
    not know your LTE site location coordinates as decimal degrees you can use https://www.latlong.net/
    to find your site on a map then copy and paste a point coordinate.

Soil Information
****************

Mandatory fields
================

WRB dominant soil type
    This is the World Reference Book dominant soil type for your site and provides a useful indicator of soil properties. 

    If you do not know the WRB soil type for your site, either use https://soilgrids.org to identify a predicated 
    class for your location, or select the *Don't know* option from the drop down list.

Recommended fields
==================

Soil description
    You can use the soil description text box to provide a text description of your soil. If you have measured properties, 
    such as bulk density or SOC, use the *Soil Properties* list to add them.

Soil properties
    You can use the soil properties section to add more detailed soil physics and chemistry information such as sand content; 
    soil organic carbon; plant available phosphorous. There is no limit to the number of soil properties you add.
    
    For each soil property you can add the following information:

    * Soil depth: provide a minimum and maximum range for the soil depth the property refers to. If you only have one depth value, enter it in the minimum depth field
    * soil depth units.
    * Is baseline: inidicates whether the soil property was measured at baseline, i.e. before the LTE started.
    * Reference year: the year when the soil property was sampled/measured. 
    * Is estimated: Check this box to indicate the property has been estimated i.e using a model. This may be the case for baseline values from older LTEs.
    * Typical: this is an average value for the soil property.
    * Minium and Maxium: this is the range of values for the soil property.
    * Units: the measurement units for the soil property.

Climate Information
*******************

Mandatory fields
================

Köppen climate classification
    This is the Köppen climate classification for your site and provides a useful indicator of climate poperties.

    If you do not know the classification for your site, either use maps at `Köppen Climate climate classification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification#Other_K%C3%B6ppen_climate_maps>`_
    to identify the class or select the *Don't know* option from the drop down list.

Recommended fields
==================

Climate Description
    You can use the climate description text box to provide a text description of your climate. If you have measured properties, 
    such as temperature or rainfall, use the *Climate Properties* list to add them.

Climate properties
    You can use the climate properties to add more detailed climate information. It is recommended to use averged annual properties (i.e. annual precipitation). 

    For each climate property you can add the following information:

    * Start year and End year: to indicate the period of years the property refers to.
    * Mean: value for the period.
    * Minimum and Maximum values: for the period.
    * Units: the measurement unit for the climate property.
